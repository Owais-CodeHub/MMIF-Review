### üìñ About This Review
This repository is a **companion resource** to our review paper:  
**‚ÄúA comprehensive review of techniques, algorithms, advancements, challenges, and clinical applications of multi-modal medical image fusion for improved diagnosis.‚Äù**

The review provides:
- üñºÔ∏è **Traditional Approaches** ‚Äì pixel-level, feature-level, decision-level fusion  
- ü§ñ **AI-Driven Fusion** ‚Äì deep learning, generative, and transformer-based methods  
- üß™ **Comparative Analysis** ‚Äì robustness, interpretability, and computational trade-offs  
- ü©∫ **Clinical Applications** ‚Äì oncology, neurology, cardiology, precision medicine  
- üöß **Challenges & Opportunities** ‚Äì privacy, heterogeneity, real-time, XAI, federated learning  

This repo extends the paper with **datasets, models, and structured summaries** to accelerate MMIF research.
