### 📖 About This Review
This repository is a **companion resource** to our review paper:  
**“A comprehensive review of techniques, algorithms, advancements, challenges, and clinical applications of multi-modal medical image fusion for improved diagnosis.”**

The review provides:
- 🖼️ **Traditional Approaches** – pixel-level, feature-level, decision-level fusion  
- 🤖 **AI-Driven Fusion** – deep learning, generative, and transformer-based methods  
- 🧪 **Comparative Analysis** – robustness, interpretability, and computational trade-offs  
- 🩺 **Clinical Applications** – oncology, neurology, cardiology, precision medicine  
- 🚧 **Challenges & Opportunities** – privacy, heterogeneity, real-time, XAI, federated learning  

This repo extends the paper with **datasets, models, and structured summaries** to accelerate MMIF research.
